When an agent calls a tool, technically the tool's entire stdout can be passed back to the agent.
However, if an OUTPUT_KEY is present in a tool's main file, only stdout content *after* this key is
passed to the agent. This allows us to return structured output to the agent while still retaining
the entire stdout stream from a tool! By default, this feature is enabled, and anything returned
from the run_tool() method above will be the structured output of the tool.
